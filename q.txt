1. Define anomaly: on a certain day, the metrics are uncommon? or weird customer behaviors and how can we track them? 
2. What metrics go wrong? Say click through rate, what benchmarks can we compare? 
3. Which metrics to look at? There are 60. 


anomaly_det_dashboard_shopper_conv
- totalshoppertraffic_visitors: #distinct of unique visitors land on the homepage 
- totalshoppertraffic_visits: #sessions 
- digital_orders: #customer place the order on the website, aggregated by 
- aal_orders: add line(plan, smartphone)
- eup_orders: upgrade
- nao_orders: other orders
- nse_orders: service
- nso_orders: other service
- nsp_orders: 
- npp_orders: plan 
- total_orders: multiple channels 
- cust_prospect_ind: All Visitors???, UNDETERMINED(not existing, visit for the first time), PROSPECT(not existing, visit again in 30days), CUSTOMER(existing)
- visit_device_type: Mobile Phone, Desktop, Tablet, Gamine Console, All Devices??????
- event_dt 2019-02-01 to 2019-03-31


1. @Monday anomaly detection analysis: daily wise: digital_orders/(customer & devices), totalshoppertraffic/(customer & devices)
2. @After that, forecasting on the seven days, on what? 


q1: conversion rate: #total_orders/#totaltraffic_visitors?  
q2: totalshoppertraffic_visitors/totalshoppertraffic_visits (rate here)
q3: Why orders are highly correlated? 





anomaly_det_dashboard
- metric
- totalshoppertraffic: is it the same as the customer_conv?
- overallcustomers, what is overall customers? Half of this column are zeros and why is that? 
- positivemovingcustomers, how do we define a movement as positive? what does it mean to have these three columns zero?
- no_movement
- overall_conversion
- positive_movement_rate > 1? 
- cust_prospect_ind
- visit_device_type
- event_dt
- funnelstage: Upper, Middle, Lower. 
	My research: in e-commerce, conversion funnel describes the different stages in a buyer's journey 
	leading up to a purchase.
	Upper: research brands/products
	Middle: interested in the brand, sign up fo email etc. Run continuous A/B tests, collect feedback, track key metrics 
	Lower: decided what they want, look for reviews etc  
	Awareness -> Interest -> Desire -> Action

q1. # positivemovingcustomers, overallcustomers, no_movement highly correlated, no movement and overallcustomers a very distinct linear relationship
